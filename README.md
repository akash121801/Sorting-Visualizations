# Sorting-Visualizations
Built a GUI that shows how 5 different sorting algorithms(Merge, Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Quick) work in real-time. The GUI allows users to customize the number of data points, the minimum and maximum of the data, the speed that the sorting algorithm is performed at, as well as the sorting algorithm itself.
